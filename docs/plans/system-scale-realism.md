# System scale realism

Make the in-system view convey realistic scale without losing usability. Two
TODO items drive this — "find a better way to preserve the scale when viewing a
solar system" and "add moons" — and they share one underlying model, so they are
planned together here.

## Problem

At true scale the dynamic range inside a system is ~10⁵–10⁶: a star is a
rounding error against its orbits, and a planet is invisible whenever its orbit
is on screen. Today ProcUniverse has two distinct issues:

- **Data (orbital architecture):** orbits only span ~0.35–8 AU, so planets are
  never very far out and inner close-in planets never appear. This is a realism
  gap in the generated data, fixable on its own.
- **Rendering (apparent size):** the exaggerated visual discs overlap
  (`starVisualRadius` ∈ [0.05, 0.70] AU, `planetVisualRadius` ∈ [0.02, 0.18] AU),
  so a big planet can render larger than a small star, and the disc is a fixed AU
  size at every zoom so true scale is never visible up close.

Real radii, masses, periods and temperatures are already physically correct — the
only data problem is *where planets are placed*.

## Phase 1 — Orbital architecture (data) — DONE (uncommitted)

Fix the three knobs that are genuinely unrealistic. Keeps the generator's
geometric (Titius–Bode-like) spacing, which is already realistic; just widens its
reach and lets close-in planets exist. This shifts the universe (every system
re-rolls), which is expected.

- [x] `ORBIT_INNER_AU` 0.25 → 0.04 — real systems are dominated by close-in
      planets (0.02–0.1 AU); an inner edge at 0.25 AU (beyond Mercury) misses them.
- [x] `PLANET_MAX` 5 → 8 — the solar system has 8; 5 caps both richness and reach.
- [x] `ORBIT_RATIO_MAX` 2.0 → 2.2 — lets some systems stretch toward Neptune-like
      distances (real big gaps reach 2–3.4×). `ORBIT_RATIO_MIN` (1.4) unchanged.
- [x] Keep `PLANET_MIN` (1) and `ECC_MAX` (0.4) — both already realistic
      (single-planet systems exist; e = u²·0.4 → mean ~0.13 matches multi-planet
      exoplanets).
- [x] Confirm build + tests + lint green (scale.test computes `widestOrbit` from
      the constants, so it auto-adapts: new max ≈ 0.04·2.2⁸ ≈ 22 AU < 632 AU sector).
- [x] Peer-reviewed (fast model) — LGTM, determinism preserved (no draw
      added/reordered; only the constant values fed to existing draws change).

Resulting reach: innermost planet 0.06–0.09 AU; outermost ~0.06 AU (sparse) to
~22 AU (max luck), most systems still compact.

## Phase 2 — Frost-line-aware spacing (data) — DONE (uncommitted)

Real systems aren't uniformly geometric: a compact inner region, then a gap and
widely-spaced outer giants beyond the frost line. Apply a wider ratio to cold
orbits so distant planets appear far more often (and dim stars, with close-in
frost lines, get cold giants without needing a huge planet count).

- [x] Add `ORBIT_RATIO_OUTER_MIN` (1.6) / `ORBIT_RATIO_OUTER_MAX` (2.5) knobs.
- [x] In `generateSectorData`, compute `frost = frostLine(L)` once per system; each
      gap takes one draw mapped to the outer range when `a >= frost`, else the inner
      range. One draw either way → deterministic stream unchanged; inner-only
      systems are byte-identical to Phase 1, only systems with cold planets shift.
- [x] Update `scale.test` worst-case guard to the true widest ratio
      (`ORBIT_INNER_AU · ORBIT_RATIO_OUTER_MAX ** PLANET_MAX` ≈ 61 AU) with a ×3
      sector margin (632 AU sector ⇒ 183 AU < 632, comfortable).
- [x] Regression test: across a 3×3 sector grid, cold planets (a ≥ frost) exist and
      the widest orbit exceeds 10 AU.
- [x] Build + tests (171) + lint green.

## Phase 3 — Star-scaled orbital bounds (data) — DONE (uncommitted)

Orbits were placed in fixed AU regardless of the star, so bright stars' planets
could never reach their distant habitable zone / frost line (all roasted) while
dim stars' planets sat too far out. Scale the planet-forming disk with the star.

- [x] Add knobs: `ORBIT_INNER_MIN_AU` (0.01, inner floor), `DISK_OUTER_AU` (50,
      Sun disk edge), `DISK_OUTER_MAX_AU` (150, saturation cap).
- [x] Inner edge = `max(ORBIT_INNER_AU·√L, ORBIT_INNER_MIN_AU)` (dust-sublimation
      radius ∝ √L; floor so faint stars don't place a planet inside themselves).
- [x] Outer disk edge = `min(DISK_OUTER_AU·√L, DISK_OUTER_MAX_AU)`; stop placing
      planets past it (a smaller disk holds fewer). Keeps Phase 2 frost-aware
      spacing. No new draws (truncation only ends a system's own loop early).
- [x] Update `scale.test` guard to the disk cap (`SECTOR_SIZE > DISK_OUTER_MAX_AU·3`
      ⇒ 450 AU < 632 AU sector). Luminosity range [6e-4, 1.2e6] L☉ ⇒ max inner edge
      ~44 AU ⇒ first planet always < 150 AU, so the cap bounds every system.
- [x] Build + tests (171) + lint green. Determinism + cold-region + ordering tests
      still pass. Shifts the universe again (every star's inner edge changes).

No sector resize was needed: the realistic disk saturates at 150 AU, well inside
the 632 AU sector. The remaining genuinely-unrealistic sector property is the
**interstellar spacing** (`LY_PER_SECTOR = 0.01` ⇒ stars ~632 AU apart vs. the
real ~light-years), tracked as a separate item below.

## Phase 3b — Interstellar spacing (data) — DONE (uncommitted), see [realistic-scale.md](realistic-scale.md)

`LY_PER_SECTOR = 0.01` packed stars ~632 AU apart; the nearest real star is 4.2 ly
≈ 268,000 AU. Pierre chose **full realism** (real spacing + Milky-Way-sized
galaxies), with navigation made usable later by rendering tricks (warp-to-target).
The cross-cutting rescale (galaxy model + LOD tiers + zoom range) is implemented
and documented in its own plan: [realistic-scale.md](realistic-scale.md).

## Phase 4 — Apparent size (rendering) — IN PROGRESS

- [x] **Step 0 — true-scale baseline.** `scale.ts` `starVisualRadius` /
      `planetVisualRadius` / `blackHoleVisualRadius` now return the body's *real*
      physical radius (R☉/R⊕→AU, real Schwarzschild radius) instead of the
      exaggerated clamped discs. Bodies are honestly tiny (a framed system shows
      near-invisible planets, no overlap) — the clean starting point. The
      `*_DISC_*` config knobs are dormant, kept to feed the morph. (Star-tier dots
      still use the `MIN_DOT` floor in `draw-stars.ts`, so the star field stays
      visible; that floor folds into the morph below.)
- [ ] Move the apparent-size decision fully out of the data layer: the data
      carries only the true physical radius; the renderer computes drawn size from
      `(trueRadius, zoom)`.
- [ ] Ordered, non-overlapping size **floors** (every star floor > every planet
      floor) so stars always dominate planets when zoomed out.
- [ ] **Morph:** as you zoom in, true physical size takes over once
      `physicalRadius × zoom` exceeds the floor — so flying up to a body shows its
      real scale (huge star, tiny planet against its orbit). No render-space
      distance warp (a radial distance compression is a fisheye — already scrapped).
- [x] Split `config.ts` into explicit `config/data.ts` (universe-generation knobs)
      and `config/render.ts` (presentation/feel); repoint all 19 imports. Prevents
      the earlier trap of tuning a data knob (`LY_PER_SECTOR`) thinking it was
      render.

## Phase 5 — Moons — NOT STARTED

Moons are the same model one level deeper (a body that becomes relevant only at a
much tighter zoom, with its own sub-framing). Generate around planets, render with
the Phase-4 floors/morph, expose in the inspector. Deferred until the scale model
settles.
